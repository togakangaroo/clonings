;; Note: Besides booleans, there are a number of values which are treated as
;; true or false in Clojure, and we call such values "truthy" or "falsey". Try
;; them out in this program!

;; Excerpt from "Clojure for the Brave and True"
;; ---------------------------------------------
;; Both nil and false are used to represent logical falsiness, whereas
;; all other values are logically truthy. Truthy and falsey refer to
;; how a value is treated in a Boolean expression, like the first
;; expression passed to if.
