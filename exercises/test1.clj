;; Mary is buying apples. One apple usually costs 2 dollars, but if you buy
;; more than 40 at once, each apple only costs 1! Write a function that calculates
;; the price of an order of apples given the order amount. No hints this time!

(ns test1)

;; Put your function here!
;; (defn calculate-price ...
(defn calculate-price [count]
  (let [price (if (> count 40) 1 2)]
    (* price count)))

;; Don't modify this function!
